ROADMAP — Post v1.0.0 (public roadmap)

Priority list (near-term → far-term):

1) v1.1.0 — Feedback & polish (1–2 months)
- Bug fixes from user reports
- Improved install scripts and model download helper
- Minor UX fixes in CLI and docs

2) v1.2.0 — TTS Integration & Streaming
- Add optional TTS module and example glue code
- Implement streaming STT prototype (lower-latency microphone input)

3) v2.0.0 — Web UI & Packaging
- User-friendly web interface (local-first)
- Prepackaged images for Raspberry Pi (one-click flash)
- Official Docker image for easy server deployment

4) Long-term (v3+)
- Model manager (download and switch models easily)
- Model fine-tuning utilities
- Community-contributed GUI plugins

How to prioritize:
- User feedback and crash reports (highest priority)
- Low-effort, high-impact features (install automation, small UX fixes)
